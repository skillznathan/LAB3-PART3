Contributors and their Contribution: 
#include <fstream>
File Handling: It allows your program to read from, write to, and create files.
Essential Classes: It enables the use of std::ifstream (for reading), std::ofstream (for writing), and std::fstream (for both).
Replaces Old Headers: It serves the same purpose as the obsolete <fstream.h>, which should not be used in modern C++.
