Contributors and their Contribution: 
#include <fstream> What it does:
File Handling: It allows your progr
am to read from, write to, and create files.
Essential Classes: It enables the use of std::ifstream (for reading), std::ofstream (for writing), and std::fstream (for both).
Replaces Old Headers: It serves the same purpose as the obsolete <fstream.h>, which should not be used in modern C++. 


#include <iomanip> what it does:

Purpose: It allows you to format data printed to the screen using cout, making it useful for creating neat, aligned tables and reports.
Common Functions: It provides parameterized manipulators, most notably setw() (set width), setprecision() (set floating-point precision), and setfill() (fill blank spaces).
Difference from <iostream>: While <iostream> handles standard input/output (like cin/cout), <iomanip> is specifically for manipulating the state of those streams.
